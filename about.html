              Virginia is originally from Uruguay, and has lived in Canada on and off since 1987, having also
              lived in Africa, the Middle East and Europe since then. She speaks Spanish fluently, and feels
              comfortable offering counselling services in that language if needed.
              Virginia has been a Registered Social Worker in the province of Alberta since 2005 (Reg. 8049);
              having graduated with her Bachelor’s in Social Work (BSW), at the University of Calgary that
              same year.
              Since 2012, she holds a Master’s Degree in Social Work (MSW) with a clinical specialization that
              she also received from the University of Calgary. She has been in counselling roles since the
              beginning of her career and has 20 years of counselling experience in Canada.

              Virginia practices from a holistic, humanistic, trauma sensitive, systemic and attachment-based
              perspective; and has extensive training in Emotionally Focused Therapy. Most of these
              approaches are experiential; meaning that they support people’s growth and healing by
              promoting a safe and healing experience in the counselling room, which people can eventually
              start to feel and replicate for themselves (self compassion), in their own environments; and
              with the people around them.

              Through different trainings, Virginia has learned (and continues to learn) about several other
              therapeutic approaches including Internal Family Systems, Psychoanalysis, Client Centered,
              Solution Focused, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, Body Based
              Psychotherapies, Mindfulness, Collaborative Problem Solving, and Gottman method couple’s
              therapy. She pulls from her overall knowledge and experience to find the approach or
              combination of approaches that is best suited to each specific client and their needs.

              Throughout her career, she has worked in domestic violence shelters, community mental
              health clinics, day treatment programs, children and adolescent inpatient mental health units;
              as well as private practice. Virginia has worked with individuals, couples and families; and
              understands the complexity of each human being and of human relationships. She is
              comfortable working with people of different ages and different backgrounds.
              Virginia has also worked intermittently in Northern Alberta over the past several years, offering
              counselling services to a large Fly in Fly Out (FIFO) population of oil field workers, and is very
              familiar with the specific challenges related to the FIFO lifestyle.
