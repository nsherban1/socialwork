              Virginia offers virtual counselling services to individuals, couples and families of all ages and
              backgrounds that reside permanently or temporarily in Alberta. In person sessions may be
              requested and offered occasionally in Calgary, although the majority of the counselling will be
              virtual.
              Sessions take place through the Jane platform which is an online platform created for health
              professionals. Jane is very easy to use and requires no downloads. Test changes.

              Virginia operates under the belief that people are doing the best that they can with the
              resources that they have, considering their histories and the specific circumstances of their
              lives. She believes that the great majority of people want to be well and do well for themselves
              and others. If they are not doing so, is because they do not have the resources or skills to do so.
              She works to support people better understand themselves and their situation; to develop self
              compassion; and to increase their mental, emotional, spiritual and relational resources, so that
              they can live more fulfilling lives. Virginia believes that self awareness and self compassion are
              key ingredients for people to achieve internal peace, as well as empathy and compassion for
              others.
              Virginia finds that in general, people also need support to become “freer” with themselves (and
              others). She often helps people “deconstruct”; or at least challenge, limiting beliefs or values
              that are experienced as “normal” or “expected”, which may go against the true nature of who
              we they are as human beings.
              Through the process of therapy, Virginia respects where people are at, and although may at
              times challenge, make suggestions and offer guidance, the process will always be collaborative
              and at the client’s pace. She invites feedback often and is open to changing the course of
              therapy as needed.
              Virginia strives to consistently offer a therapeutic space where clients feel safe, seen, heard and
              cared for. Her practice is always trauma sensitive and strength based.

              Counselling in the context of private practice is completely voluntary. If needed, ongoing
              treatment will likely be discussed collaboratively with you after the first session. Your counselor
              may suggest a specific treatment plan or frequency of sessions; however, it is always up to you

              to decide whether you will continue after the first session and/or, how often you would like to
              attend.
              Counselling can be many different things to different people. In general, people reach out when
              something in their lives is not going in the way that they would like it to go, when they struggle
              with mood concerns, addictions, emotional regulation; or when relationships are not working
              out. Others reach out for emotional support after a loss, parenting concerns or guidance; and
              others, simply want the support to become the best version of themselves.
              Virginia offers help in all those areas, as well as any other curiosity or concern people may
              present with. She also offers recommendations/referrals to other services, if what someone
              brings to a session is beyond the expertise and the support that she is be able to provide.
              Whatever the initial reason to engage in counselling may be, most people find it helpful and
              feel that they gain something from it. Often, people leave with more clarity or/and a different
              perspective on their situation or concern after their first session.
              It is important to feel comfortable with your therapist. The relationship should feel emotionally
              safe and you should feel seen and heard consistently throughout the process. In other words, it
              is important that the therapist you chose is a good “match” for you. That will make the process
              more enjoyable and more effective. The therapist should be open to receiving feedback at any
              time during the therapeutic process, and be willing to address any concerns openly, with
              flexibility and without judgement.
